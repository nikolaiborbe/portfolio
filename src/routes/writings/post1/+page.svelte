<h2 class="text-2xl">A Morning</h2>

<p>
	The darkness about the place, the creeping cold air, and the ever now and then grunts, could be
	smelt flowing through the air like the ocean on a quiet beach flowing to and fro with the
	moon-tide. A young boy, his family name was not important, nor his history, or legacy, just that
	he went by Boh, laid on an almost empty air mattress. His hair was blond but dark, and was filled
	with mud and dirt, he had bright sky-blue eyes, and was lean of figure; on his left forearm he
	carried an anker tattoo. The mattress he had been using eminently for the last couple of weeks was
	holding vigorously up through the long days. Next to him lay his companion, and only listener,
	Mykola. A bit shorter of stature, but still as handsome as himself. Slowly rising, head bent down,
	he quietly made his way out of the tent. After he left the tent, he made his way over to the
	hillside where they had set up a fireplace and kept their ever-shrinking military ration next to a
	large boulder side; it was Polish dry powder stew, American dry powder stew, and British dry
	powder chili con carne; the bags only required a bit of water to be made into a decent meal. Next
	to the food was the coffee powder which he grabbed and stirred into two wooden cups, creating a
	morning. Boh made his way over to the tent, entered, and carefully shook Mykola till he awaked.
	“Good morning” Mykola grunted, massaging his eyes. “I made you coffee” Boh whispered, reaching his
	hand out giving him the wooden cup. It had been days, maybe even weeks since it was lasted washed;
	it was made of oak but was dark after being (oiled up to keep it from growing old). “Momma’s
	favorite” was engraved on the side, and the handle had broken off, leaving only one way of holding
	the cup. “Thanks, Boh!” He responded, lifting his head up taking a sip. “I had the nightmare again
	Boh, can’t seem to shake it. Every day, I see his face, his young innocent face. I can’t bare it.”
	It took some time for Boh to responded, picking the sentence carefully: “He would have killed you.
	If you didn’t, …, you wouldn’t be here enjoying this coffee with me now.” “I’m growing less and
	less sure he would have Boh, and less and less sure in myself at the same time. He wasn’t a
	killer, he was just a scared little kid, younger than me, I’m sure. Maybe he not shooting first
	makes me… I should have given him the choice to be unsullied, to prove his innocence, but I took
	that choice from him.” Realizing he could do no good Boh responded “Get up, it’s a great day, and
	we have new intel we need to look into”. Both the lads got dressed and headed to the boulder where
	they had set up a living area. They had set up a laptop, a Starlink terminal and some electronics
	into the rock-wall to the left of their ration. With a little roof made out of a few planks and
	logs, a layer of tarp to keep the water guided elsewhere, and to cover it all up, branches from
	fir tree had been used, they had created a fine little workstation. Over on the other side of
	their ration, they kept a well-crafted, little, fireplace. Next to it was a few days work of (cut
	up wood) hid in a woodshed that also was covered in fir tree branches. Everything was made to look
	invisible to anyone that might’ve found their way into the endless depth of the far-reaching
	forest hugging Kiev. “Any updates?” Mykola asked. He was the oldest and had taken on the
	responsibility of contacting all the other groups located around Kiev; twice a day, at 9 am and
	pm, he wrote, updating the Telegram group everything was fine. They were part of an established
	group of civilians tasked with covering the area around Kiev and updating the Ukrainian military
	of enemy position. He was also responsible for the rations. Boh on the other hand was the fixer in
	the duo, he was their engineer, their medic, and relevant for this situation, their IT person. Boh
	had settled down on a stump and was reading updates from their specialized energy-efficient
	computer. They had set up a couple hidden solar panels around the zone to charge the few batteries
	they needed, using the cover of all types of vegetation to their advantage. “Kiev has fallen.” Boh
	looked up, with a concerned expression fixed on his face. “Go and activate the alarms. I will hide
	all of our stuff. Starting tonight, we will do night watches, 4-hour rotations. Remember, our job
	is to get intel when they pass. If we get caught, we are dead.” Mykola Cried. “I’m scared Mykola!”
	Boh answered.

<p>
	After a good hour of work, they met back up. Mykola, after having dug down all their ration,
	packed the computer and all the electronics, and disassembled and hid the shelter, was excused.
	The same was Boh, after having hurried his way around a 3 kilometers radius, activating all their
	hidden alarms. Now they felt relatively safe at least. “All done!” Boh cried out to Mykola in a
	distance. “Same!” he quickly responded, both meeting up at the camp. “When do you think they’ll be
	here?” Boh asked. “Could be at any time, remember, the alarms don’t have to be activated for them
	to have passed through. They can malfunction, we can’t be sure they are not already here. We need
	to be on high alert. I’ll make us some lunch, head to the hill and bring the radio, I’ll bring the
	food. And for god’s sake. Stay quiet.” Mykola cried. Boh did as commanded and quickly grabbed a
	radio, he shucked the other one to Mykola, and was already a good way up the hill before it got
	caught. Using the small trees, and stone cracks to drag himself up, Boh quickly found his way to
	the top. They had dug a little divot that gave them a good overlook of the forest surrounding
	them. The hideout was specifically made for this situation: see the enemy, report, and hide. In
	the divot they had water, food, and a couple of spare batteries, enough to let them stay there for
	3 days straight. They had no guns other than a pistol each; the idea was that if they got caught,
	they would be dead either way, and not having a gun would incentivize hiding; Ukraine also had a
	shortage of guns, and the few they had where needed elsewhere. Boh laid himself down onto his
	black and brown sheepskin that was gifted to him by another civilian. The man told him he had left
	his old job as a sheep farmer to help out the resistance. Giving all the sheepskins away to anyone
	that might need them, probably expecting not to return (show don’t tell?). Boh had only been up on
	the hill once before when he was helping Mykola dig. They hadn’t brought a lot of tools, so they
	both used a simple pocketknife and their hands for the job. Looking out over the quiet forest Boh
	felt his blood cool. “Mykola, I’m all set up on Asgard, over.” Boh called over the radio. “I can
	hear you clearly, over and out.” Mykola responded after a while, “the food will be done shortly.”
	15 minutes pasted before Mykola could be heard making his way up the hill, taking the easier, but
	longer route. “Here’s your stew. It might be your last for a while, so enjoy it dearly.” “Thanks!”
	Boh responded, reaching out and grabbing the mix. “Now we’ll wait.”

<p>
	Two hours passed with little to no talking. Just a simple comment every now and then. Both where
	daydreaming to themselves and had little interest in talking. Suddenly they heard a quiet beeping
	noise coming from the computer. Boh instinctively raised his head, looking straight into Mykolas
	eyes, then quickly at the computer. He quickly reached for the computer and opened it, vigorously
	scanning for information. “The North-east alarm in sector four is triggered,” he said. “Fuck!”
	“I’m scared Mykola. I’m scared” “Stay calm. As long as we don’t get seen, we should be good.” The
	sun was rising more and more and the temperature with it. It was still late winter, so icy snow
	was covering the moss and humus hiding underneath.
</p>

<br />

<h2 class="text-2xl">A Day</h2>

<p>
	Two long hours went by, and slowly they started feeling sick with apprehension. They could hear
	sounds of wind, and all the sounds the wind would create, even the imaginary ones. The only thing
	keeping them from growing insane was the time still ticking forward. In a normal situation they
	would both be on the brink of a deep and slumber sleep, but the tension rising made sure that
	would not happen. The sheepskin was slowly growing more and more uncomfortable as the lads
	continuously kept shifting around. A bird (tweak?) could be heard every now and then, and the echo
	from a cat owl was constantly felt through the forest. “Did you hear that,” Mykola whispered.
	“Hear what?” “The branch crying!” “No?” said Boh, as quietly as he could manage. “There it was
	again, did you...” “Yeah, shut up!” Boh quickly responded. They were lying dead still for what
	felt like an eternity. Then it happened again, and again. Footsteps where quietly getting closer.
	Suddenly Boh saw the outline of a small figure ever getting closer. “Over there,” Boh nodded.
	Mykola had also heard it and was already staring straight at what looked like a man coming closer.
	“It’s only one.” Boh whispered. “I can see it,” Mykola agreed “just be quiet and keep your head
	down.” The man was slowly getting closer and was slowly headed towards their camp. “What the fuck
	do we do!” Boh panicked. “Just stay down, don’t make any fucking noise!” Mykola whispered angerly.
	“What if he finds our stuff?” “He won’t.” “But…” Boh started. “If he does, we will take him
	hostage. Simple as that, but he won’t.” Mykola interrupted. The man, only a few meters away now
	suddenly stopped where they could see him clearly. The man wasn’t a man, he was a boy. Probably no
	more than 18 years, maybe even younger. He was wearing a Russian, over-sized, military uniform.
	His face, even though it was very dirty, was spotless, unscared, unshaped. He was clearly alone
	because he was scared. Over his right shoulder he was carrying a military assault rifle (name). He
	had taken off his (west) and was not carrying any visible ammunition or explosives. On his back he
	was carrying a black, and dark blue, backpack, not of the military kind, this one he had probably
	found on his adventure. The boy was looking around, it seemed like he had spotted something, only
	standing a couple of meters away from their hidden rations. The snow looked different in this
	area, almost like it had been used. The boy suddenly and quickly turned his head around, then
	back, when he looked back, he had a realization, slowly looking to the snow then lifting his head
	slowly, searching the hillside, slowly rising, until he was staring them both in the eyes. It took
	a couple of seconds before anyone reacted, but all at the same time panicked and reach for their
	guns. The kid was quickest and just after a seconds started firing; holding down his trigger
	bullets went flying all around them, many hitting the hill right under, many the trees behind
	them, but no bullet got close. No more than 15 bullets were fired before the gun stopped, it
	wasn’t responding to the trigger. He tried again and again but he knew he was out. Mykola and Boh
	quickly realized and were down the hill and was holding him at gunpoint before he could realize
	what had happened. “Don’t Fucking Move a Finger!” Mykola yelled. Now standing only two arm
	distances away. “I will shoot if you test me,” Mykola cried, a lot quieter this time. The kid was
	scared out of his mind, arms and legs shaking, a few tears rolling downs his cheekbones. You could
	see a little wet spot on his crotch slowly moving down his left inner pant leg. “Please don’t
	kill. Please,” the kid begged slowly bending his knees and putting his head down, “please.” “Are
	you Russian?” Mykola asked in an almost whispering voice, scared of being heard, but still wanting
	to make sure the kid heard him. “Yes, yes I am. My name is Nikolai, I ran away from my unit, I
	want no harm. Please don’t kill me.” “What the fuck do we do now Mykola?” Boh whispered
	aggressively. It took some time before Mykola responded. “You remember when we saw Lone Survivors
	in the cinema, and what happened to the Matt Damon guy.” “Are you saying we should kill him?” “No,
	no, my point was only that we can’t trust he won’t run back, so we need to think of something
	else.” “We can use the ropes from the tents to tie him up. Then we take the moss under the snow
	and a branch and stick it in his mouth to keep him quiet. You can take the spare fir branches and
	hide him next to the boulder side. We will give him some water and food once a day, and then take
	him with us when we leave for Kaniv.” “You do know there can be more Russians, right? We should
	just strangle and hide him. It’s too risky not to.” “You don’t want to kill someone; he will haunt
	your memory till the day you die. You will not be able to live a happy man again Boh. Trust me.”
	“At least I will have a life.” Boh angerly responded. “The grief I have suffered makes me question
	the value of life, I see his innocent face every day when I go to bed, and he was holding me in a
	stalemate. This one can’t do us anything.” Mykola said frustrated. “Have it your way, but we
	should still question him.” “Yeah, yeah, of course.” The kid had calmed down after the reassurance
	he might not die.

	"Are the Russians headed this way?" Said Mykola. "I, I don't know. As I said I, ran away from my
	unit right after they captured Kiev, about 24 hours ago." Nikolai responded calmly. "I found this
	backpack on my way here. Stuffed it with food I stole from an elderly woman in an old small red
	house about 5 kilometers that way," he said pointing in the direction he came from. "My plan was
	to try to get into Poland with the civilians and hide out the war," he continued. "If you let me
	go I'll be on my way and you will never see me again." Boh looked to Mykola who had a concerned
	look fixed to his face. "He could be telling the truth," said Boh. "I know, but he could not be.
	Let's tie him up, and when we leave in tree days we let him go. If he is telling the truth he
	should still be able to get to Poland safely." Mykola concluded. Boh made his way towards their
	dug down tent. They had no use for it anymore seeing that comfort was far too risky. He brushed
	away the snow until he found the outer layer of their old green tent. He dragged it out, letting
	the snow fall from the side until he could see a thin yellow line appear. Following that, he
	grabbed his small pocket knife–he had kept it from his days as a sailor and liked to show it off.
	The knife was a flip knife, with a worn out shaft. On the shaft was engraved 63, his own number.
	He grabbed the line, putting his knife into a little loop he made with the rope and cut it off. He
	did this to all the lines creating seven or so small segments of the yellow line. Continuing, he
	grabbed the lines and tied them together using sheet bends––a knot his old captain thought him.
	Having now made a long line he took a good hold of the thin top layer of the tent and dragged it
	out. Using his knife, he cut up squares which he thought might be found useful as a (mouth cover
	to keep Nikolai quiet). Once he was done he took the scrap material and hid it under a new layer
	of wet snow. It was a good thing they were leaving in three days since the snow was about to melt
	leaving all their stuff out in the open. Boh made his way back to Mykola who was still holding
	Nikolai at gun point. "Here, I have made a line and some material I thought we could use as a
	(mouth cover to keep Nikolai quiet)," Boh called out. The lads took a hold of Nikolai, first
	taking the rope around his hands, then tightening it by going around the rope. This created a
	really solid, and almost too tight hold around his hands. Once done they took the rest of the rope
	and continued the pattern around his leg before they finished by lashing his hands and feet close
	together forcing Nikolai into a strange, bent back, yoga position. After, they curled up the tent
	material Boh had made into a thick roll and forced it tight into his mouth and around his head
	creating a bit. Finishing up, Boh went around gathering fir branches which they used to hide
	Nikolai body. "We will come back checking on you every now and then. If you want to live, don't
	move and stay quiet," Mykola whispered aggressively in a threatening manner. Boh and Mykola made
	their way back up the hill. After reaching the summit Mykola turned to Boh. "We did the right
	thing." (Note: make sure fir trees grow in Ukrain.)

	The weather had turned dark, and rain clouds could be spotted through the cracks in the roof of
	the forrest. Out of no where they hear Nikolai making his best effort to call out for help. He
	quickly found out it was difficult to make any audible words through the (mouth cover to keep
	Nikolai quiet) but never the less Boh and Mykola had heard him. Boh made his way down the hill
	using the stems of the small trees as support. "Shut it." Boh said aggressively. Nikolai in
	response continued to make the same inaudible noise as before. Boh saw no other solution and
	decided to gently remove the (mouth cover to keep Nikolai quiet) from Nikolai's mouth. "My hands,"
	said Nikolai, who had lost all life from his voice. Boh rolled Nikolai's limp body over, letting
	it fall down on its side after reaching the tipping point. He saw right away that something was
	wrong. His bare hands were blue; his fingers were dark probably from a combination of the cold and
	the tight ropes. "Please loosen the ropes, just a bit. I can't feel my hands any longer." Boh
	quickly realized that he couldn't let Nikolai stay like this and decided to loosen the ropes.
	"This won't work," Boh decided, loosening the ropes on his foot as well. "You won't run away will
	you?" "No, no, not at all." Boh didn't really care about Nikolai's response, feeling bad for what
	they had done to him he was confident, or maybe regretfully hopeful, he wouldn't try anything. The
	only rope now tied to Nikolai's body was a symbolic loose rope around his arms. "Come with me,"
	Boh decided leading the way up the hill. After reaching the summit, and turning away Mykola's
	questioning face, Boh told Nikolai to lay down besides them. "He would have died if we let him
	stay down there. It's too hot for the snow, but too cold for the body. He would be laying dead in
	a frozen layer of ice by nightfall." Mykola seemed to agree, once scared for his life, now used to
	the feeling, it wasn't such a big deal any longer. Boh laid himself down onto the sheepskin,
	keeping an eye on Nikolai. He was only laying a meter to his right, and could easily be spotted
	from the ground.The boys had gotten used to each other, and not after long they where talking in a
	lively, but still very quiet, manner. "Where are you from Nikolai?" Mykola asked gently. "Moscow,
	I'm from Moscow, in a small block in the Northern part of the city." Nikolai responded. "I grew up
	there, and was still living there with my mom and dad and two brothers before going into this
	meaningless war." "How old are you kid?" Boh said. "Kid? It's not like you are much older," he
	marked, "I turned 18 this January." "How old are your brothers?" "One as old as you I would
	imagine, he's 20. One younger, he's 15. My older brother was recruited at the same time as me, I
	think he is stationed in Kharkiv. They didn't want us to be together," said Nikolai with a sad
	tone in his voice. "I haven't seen him or my family in 5 months." "I am sorry to hear," said Boh,
	turning his head over and checking on Nikolai's hands. They were less blue, and had finally
	started to get some color back into them. It had been many hours since last time they ate, so Boh
	decided to go down the hill to boil some snow into water for a stew. He dug where he knew the
	ration was hidden, soon finding the plastic box they kept their food in. He opened it, digging
	through the bags until he found himself three packets off stew. He dug the box back down into the
	hole, and then went onto looking for dead fir-tree branches, the type that is excellent for
	starting a fire with. He had to walk 500 meters away from the camp until he found something
	promising. The tree was tall, but manageable. Using his saw, he found a good spot and started
	pushing it to and fro. With every push digging deeper into the stem of the tree. After a good
	minute he started getting through and the tree was slowly leaning further and further, suffering
	more and more, wanting to lay down dead. Finally the tree had had enough, and decided to fall,
	making a large cracking noise while tipping and a vey loud bang that echoed through the forrest
	when it landed. Boh noticed the strangeness to the bang and quickly decided that something was
	off. He quickly started running for the camp, realizing what might have happened. With every step
	he was growing more and more worried. Running faster and faster he was feeling his stomach aching
	for food. He hadn't eaten for almost nine hours and was starting to feel his legs and body
	fatigue. Hoping for the best, he decided to take a quick brake to catch his breath. All of a
	sudden he heard chattering off in a distance, but not from the camp, and not any voices he
	recognized. There were many voices, and all coming from slightly different directions. Fearing the
	worst, Boh went to grab his gun, but vigorously looking for it he didn't find it; he had left his
	pistol at the camp. How stupid of him he thought to himself, but decided to take a closer look.
	Slowly moving towards the camp. He felt as if he was suddenly filled with a strong courage that he
	had never felt before. With every step he was slowly getting closer; his foot was making cracking
	noises in the snow, he moved from tree to tree, using them as cover. "What should we do with this
	guy?" Boh could hear in a distance. Seeing the outline of many people, he counted 11. It looked
	like they had spotted their lookout point, and on it was laying a body. He could see it on the
	jacket, and it was like he had feared, Mykolas dead body. The corpse was laying on its stomach
	with the face planted firmly in the ground. The back of his head was open, letting the wind hit
	directly into an open wound as large as a tennis ball. There was blood covering the snow all
	around him, and down, down, flowing down the hill like a river on a mountainside. Next to his body
	stood a tall Russian soldier, he was holding his gun close to Mykola's face and was using it to
	push his body parts curiously around. Boh had started scanning for any sight of Nikolai, but
	couldn't see him anywhere. Filled with sadness, he felt alone. Boh knew there was no use in
	staying hidden behind the tree just waiting to be found. After a short moment of grief he took up
	the pace and headed for Kaniv, carrying his memory of Mykola deep within.
</p>

<br />

<h2 class="text-2xl">A Night</h2>

<p>
	Nikolai let a few moments pass after Boh had left. He knew that this was his best opportunity to
	escape, especially now that the ropes where to loose for their intended purpose. Nikolai had grown
	a liking to the lads and didn't want to inflict them any pain; he simply planned to steal Mykola's
	gun, grab a bit of food, and escape. He waited just a couple of seconds before he started twisting
	his wrists slowly, turning them from side to side, ever loosening the rope. After just a couple of
	minutes he knew they where loose enough to let his hands escape. He pulled gently, no good. He
	tried again, now with explosive force; the rope let his hands go from their tight grip. Right away
	Nikolai launched for the pistol on Mykola's side. He managed to grab it quickly before Mykola
	realized. "Don't move!" Nikolai said with a scared tone in his voice. He hadn't planned this exact
	moment and understood that this next part was going to be tricky. "Just let me go and I won't hurt
	you." "Ok!" Mykola replied. Nikolai had to act quickly since Boh could come back at any time. He
	used the hand he was holding the gun with–it was still numb after the tight ropes–and managed to
	pull off the remaining rope. "Just stay here and I'll be on my way," Nikolai said while he raised
	his head, having looked to his hands so he could more easily untie the rope. He now looked
	straight into the barrel of Mykola's gun, pointing straight towards his head. Nikolai realized he
	hadn't grabbed Mykolas gun, rather, Boh had forgot to bring his own and he was now holding his
	gun. In a panic Nikolai pressed the trigger on his gun. Suddenly, a bullet jumped out of his gun,
	flying with incredible speed towards Mykola. Before he had realized what he had done Mykola's face
	was pushed back, and as his body followed, he landed face first on the snow right outside of the
	divot. Filled with shock, Nikolai felled back. He didn't quite understand what he had just done;
	he had never killed anyone before. He felt a certain emptiness and loneliness, but his
	survival-instincts quickly kicked in and he was well on his was before the blood-river from the
	cadaver had reached the bottom of the hillside. Never to be seen again.
